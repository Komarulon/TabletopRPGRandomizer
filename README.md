# Tabletop RPG Randomizer

## What?

Inspired by retro game randomizers (Super Metroid randomizers, A Link to the Past, Final Fantasy IV, etc) I had the idea - what if a tabletop RPG (think dungeons and dragons) was randomized?

Thus, the tabletop RPG rando was born. Here's the sample idea I had when creating this:


Imagine you start out as 3 adventurers in a bright pink tavern. The barkeep is a dragon. It gives you a quest to go retrieve the wooden potato from the cave of short wrinkles. You travel to the cave and come across a team of librarians who attack. After combat, you loot the librarians. You find a golden spoon, 7 Excaliburs, a quiver of +1 Arrows, and 140,963 gold. You arrive at the cave of short wrinkles. There is a solid green ice door covering the cave. You enter the cave to the interior of the castle. Sitting in Dracula's chair is Mario. Mario dies because he starts the battle with the instant death status effect. Behind the chair is a chest with the Wooden Potato and a reward of a bar of iron, the Crash Bomber, and 7 gold. Also two of you are dressed in a terrifying combinations of colors but one of you looks super cool in randomized colors.

## What's Randomized? And How?

The randomizer uses a json file with a massive list of names, nouns, adjectives, magical effects, etc to randomize from. The system pulls weighted values from this list when you ask it to. the GM will have to pull from those options to create the world, for example as you enter a town the GM may click the building button to generate several businesses. When entering, they can then create an armed person as a guard, a shopkeeper, and a list of sold items. 

* Main Quests
* Big Bad Evil Guy
